AIM: BITWISE OPERATORS IN CPP
THEORY:
Bitwise operators in C++ provide a powerful way to manipulate data at the binary level by directly operating on the individual bits of integer values. Unlike arithmetic or logical operators that work with whole numbers or boolean values, bitwise operators treat numbers as sequences of bits (0s and 1s) and perform operations on each corresponding bit pair. The primary bitwise operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). The AND operator returns 1 for each bit position where both operands have 1s, while the OR operator returns 1 if at least one operand has a 1 in that position. The XOR operator returns 1 only when the bits differ, making it useful for toggling bits. The NOT operator inverts each bit, changing 1s to 0s and vice versa. Shift operators move bits to the left or right, effectively multiplying or dividing the value by powers of two, which can be more efficient than using arithmetic operations. Bitwise operators are commonly used in low-level programming tasks such as setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits in flags or masks, manipulating hardware registers, encoding and decoding data, and optimizing performance-critical code. Mastery of bitwise operations is essential for understanding how data is represented and processed in memory, making them invaluable tools for systems programming, embedded development, and situations requiring fine control over data at the bit level.
